## What is TinyPortal?

TinyPortal is a mod for SMF that adds a powerful and mature CMS to your SMF Forum in minutes, with native integration, without having to worry about bridging, database, and appearance. Your SMF and TP will be a homogenous ensemble from installation. It's up to you and your creativity to use TP's features to customize your site and organize its content.

## Features included in TinyPortal:

- **Article System:** The article system gives you a CMS system tightly integrated with your forum. Write articles in php, html or bbcode, and choose what member-groups can access them, who can contribute, and how they are approved.

- **Blocks and Panels:** Blocks is a term for the rectangles of information you can use throughout the portal. For the sake of simplicity the page has been divided into the "panels", which when combined can mimic many common page layouts. Blocks can contain regular html, BBC, php code or special written functions that collect specific types of information. You can show them according to which permissions the visitor has, and even show them just in certain sections. 
TinyPortal comes with a number of standard block types, such as: Recent Posts, Theme switcher, Search, Calendar, Poll, RSS feeds, Menu, User Profile block and News.

- **Menu Manager:** The menu manager lets you add single level Buttons / Tabs to the SMF menu, but also create menu's within a portal block available to specific membergroups. You can create and organize various types of menu items: links to articles, categories, or even just a custom link. You can choose to have the link open in the current window or a new window.

- **Downloads Manager**: A built-in module for TP that lets you offer files for your members to browse and download. Its works by having the downloadable files placed in categories, letting you restrict member groups access level per each category.

- **ShoutBox:** An intergrated message box in which you can leave messages for others to see and thus maintain a simple "chat" on the site. Combined with permissions you will have much freedom in who can participate as well.

### Changelog
Please click on the appropriate release to see the [Changelog](https://github.com/Tinyportal/TinyPortal/tags)

### NOTICE!
Because of the database changes in TP 2.x.x versions there's no going back to TP 1.x.x after installing a TP 2.x version. You can install previous versions, but by doing that you WILL lose TP data and you will need to manually fix or recreate your content!!! This will also result in issues upgrading to TP2.x later on.
For these reasons it's advised to backup your database and files before proceeding.
